# Inventory-Management-GUI Project using Java
# This project is my final project for Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Language using Java.
# This project uses Javafx fxml application rather than javafx which is easier to create and design and interface.
# This project has used mainly two objects entry and member for adding entries and member into the file.
# When it is opened it will prompt you to enter id and password which are stored in file. And if you are new user then it will prompt you     to create user-id and password corresponds to it.
# This is singly written by me with the help from many other sources. 
# The sole purpose of this project is to get familier into object and javafx.
# As it is the project no.7 for EECS 1510 course which is taught by Professor Dr. Henry F. Ledgard. He is great guyand very knowledgable     for this course.
# This program can be used as the reference for other java projects involving inventory management. Please do not  copy code line by line     unless you inderstand it first. And if you want to use any fragments of the code as the part of your code then just make sure you provide   the better reasoning to your Professor.
# All the images used in this programs are downloaded from google and can be removed if requseted to remove by original author.
# I have us hashset in very efficient way to provide auto text generator in text field.
# This code can be used by any people who want to learn something more about objects and hashset in java.
# I have also used css to make my interface look nicer.
